## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node 8](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- [Serverless](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/)

### Running the Application

On inital clone, please be sure to get all of the libraries.

> yarn install

**Note for WebStorm users:** The Figlet library takes eons to index feel free to remove it for local development

> rm -rf node_modules/figlet/importable-fonts

Just run the following command to get the server running:

> yarn start

However, there is no direct output from ExYos.
So you are best off just writing tests to exercise your functionality. (Hurray test driven development).
There are plenty of good examples :D.

### Running the Tests

> yarn test

```$xslt
